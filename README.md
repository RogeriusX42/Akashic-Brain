## 🚀 Key Features & Capabilities 🚀

The Akashic Brain is built upon a robust, interconnected database structure, allowing for unparalleled organization and insight:

* **Hierarchical Time Management:** Seamlessly link daily data points to specific Weeks, Quarters, and Years, providing a holistic overview of your progress.
* **Granular Data Capture:** A comprehensive `Data Point` schema to log every thought, idea, task, and reflection with rich context (timestamps, topics, sentiments, connections).
* **Automated Context & Connections:** Intelligent relationships between data points allow you to trace the evolution of ideas and decisions.
* **Dynamic Dashboards:** Designed for a "cockpit intelligence" view, enabling quick insights into your productivity and focus.
* **Multi-Language Support:** The project aims for modular accessibility, allowing the core concepts and documentation to be understood globally.

## 🔬 Scientific Foundations: The Roots of Sovereignty 🔬

The concept behind the Akashic Brain is deeply rooted in various scientific disciplines, each contributing a vital piece to the puzzle of optimizing human performance and well-being. Understanding these foundations empowers us to build systems that truly resonate with our innate capabilities.

* **Cognitive Engineering:** Designing systems and interfaces that enhance human cognitive abilities (memory, attention, decision-making).
* **Somatics:** Exploring the mind-body connection and how bodily sensations influence thoughts and emotions.
* **Neuroscience:** Providing insights into how the brain processes, stores, and retrieves information.
* **Biology:** Examining fundamental biological processes underpinning human existence, impacting cognitive function.
* **Psychology:** Offering frameworks for understanding human behavior, motivation, habits, and decision biases.
* **Philosophy:** Delving into fundamental questions about knowledge, existence, and the nature of reality, shaping purpose and ethics.

All these disciplines converge to illuminate the path towards: **👑 Cognitive & Physical Sovereignty 👑** – empowering individuals to master their internal world (thoughts, emotions) and external actions (physical well-being, productivity) through a harmonized system of knowledge and self-awareness.

    * `ID`, `Timestamp`, `WeekDay`, `Title`, `Raw Text`, `Topics`, `Sentiments`, `Labels`, `Connections`, `Previous Data Point`, `Previous Context`, `Possible Next Data Point`, `Possible Next Context`, `Possible Next Steps`, `Action Chosen`, `Week Relation`, `Date Relation`.
2.  **The Weekly Chronicle: Weeks Database:** Manages your weekly cycles.
    * `Week ID`, `Start Date`, `End Date`, `Quarter Relation`, `Total Data Points (Rollup)`, `Weekly Goals`.
3.  **The Quarterly Campaign: Quarters Database:** Manages your quarterly cycles (13 weeks each).
    * `Quarter ID`, `Start Date`, `End Date`, `Year Relation`, `Weeks Relation`, `Total Data Points (Rollup)`, `Quarterly Goals`.
4.  **The Annual Saga: Years Database:** Provides the highest strategic view.
    * `Year`, `Start Date`, `End Date`, `Quarters Relation`, `Total Data Points (Rollup)`, `Yearly Goals`.
5.  **The Grand Almanac: Date Table:** A comprehensive calendar dimension.
    * `Date`, `Day of Week Name`, `Day of Week Number`, `Day of Month`, `Week Number`, `Month Name`, `Month Number`, `Quarter Name`, `Year`, `Is Weekend?`, `Is Holiday?`.
